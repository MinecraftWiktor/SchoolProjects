# SchoolProjects (Redesigned)
Some weird things I do during lessons

## Whats new?
<li>Photos show almost the entire site</li>
<li>From now on, all projects can be conveniently downloaded using the "download" button</li>
<li>Python files are finally avaliable to download and view</li>
<li>Dziwne strony (Weird Sites) -  I changed name to "Inne strony" (Other sites)<br> 
They were moved from my larger site to this project, (and I also added their imgs)</li>
<li>There is also a photos tab on the site, where you can download photos (which are not under a free license), for use in your school projects</li>
